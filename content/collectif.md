description: >-
  Maria Clara is a scenographer and artist based between Geneva and Lugano. \

  In her research and practice, she explores the tension between intentional and accidental events, focusing on how this dialogue generates unexpected spatial narratives, both in reality as well as in fiction. In particular, she investigates the link between space and words, finding in language an indirect way to create places of imagery.\

  She graduated in Art and Theatre History (Alma Mater Studiorum, Bologna), in Interior Architecture (Head, Genève) and in Scenography (La Manufacture, Lausanne). As a scenographer, she collaborated with dancer and choreographer Mathilde Monnier. She worked as teaching assistant in Head – Genève. She is currently associate artist of the Comédie de Genève, in collaboration with director Eléonore Bonah, with whom she created the play *Lenz*.
